                    <p class="AText">There are a lot of things I am interested in and many hobbies I would like to one day be able to have, but as of right now my hobbies are pretty simple.<br>
                        My hobbies include playing sports, playing board games, and (especially in the winter) videogames. Other than this you could say watching tv/anime is anohter along with listening to music.

                </div>
                <div class="box"><h3>Sports</h3>
                    <p class="AText">As a kid and to theis day I have always quite enjoyed playing sports. From probably as soon as you could i was playing soccer.
                        I continued to play soccer and when i was old enough started playing rep (I was 7). I played rep every year until grade 10 when I stoped playing.
                        The reason I stoped was because within the last four years i had one team fold, and the other was constantly having players leave after the season.
                        This meant that my team was always 'new' and had no chemistry. I still enjoy to play soccer and am considering joining either intrmurals or a mens league soon.
