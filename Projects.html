                <h3>My Favourite Projects</h3>
                <p>Just like those in the classrooms around me, I have done many projects over the years.
                    My favourites of which are:<br><br> 1. The Standard model of Particles, 2. Oceans, and 3. The Zoo <br><br>
                    Theses are my most memorable projects to date and were by far the most fun (for different reasons).

                <h4>The Standard Model of Particles</h4>
                <p>This is by far my favourite project I have worked on ever. And there are a lot of reasons as to why.
                    The first being that I went into this topic completly blind. This was my assigned ISU for grade 12 physics.
                    My teacher wanted us to have to self teach a topic on something we likely had little to no real understanding of. 
                    In my case, I had never even heard of the Standard Model. This meant that I would have to do a lot of research. And normally this wasn't something
                    I was fond of. But I had managed to come across some great resources to help myself understand what the Stadard Model is. These publishes made it 'easy' to understand.
                    Something that also made this a memorable project was the fact that by the end of I had had my eyes opened to what everything really is. 
                    I put a lot more 'effort' into this project and got a lot more out of it than I had ever expected to. This is what makes it my favourite project.

            <article id="Ocean">
                <h4>Oceans</h4>
                <p>My next favourite project was my grade 9 science ISU. This project has a few similar reasons to the Standard Model project. 
                    Firstly, this project incomparison is waaaaay more relaxed. I mean it is grade 9 vs. grade 12 so it makes sense that this would be easier.
                    Secondly, just like with the Standard Model, i learnt a lot from this project. Now, what I learned was nowhere near as in depth or as specific but I learned nonehteless.
                    I got to find a lot of facts and present on many different aspects. I mean, afterall my topic was literally 'Oceans'. A little broad if you ask me but I managed.
